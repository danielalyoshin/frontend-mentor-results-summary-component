## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

For this component, I had to work through several obstacles to tackle responsiveness. Having managed to get the component to look good on various screen sizes has helped to grow my understanding of Flexbox and media queries.

### Continued development

In the future, I intend to complete more of these mini-projects, including those using JavaScript, after which I will move on to learning frameworks such as React, Svelte, and Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources
